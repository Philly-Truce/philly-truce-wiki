## Our Mission

**At PHILLY TRUCE, our mission is to reduce gun violence and promote a culture of peace in Philadelphia communities.**

We are dedicated to empowering individuals, engaging communities, and building technology to foster safer neighborhoods and encourage nonviolent paths.

By providing resources and tools to help de-escalate conflicts, we strive to transform Philadelphia into a city where peace prevails, and all residents can live free from the fear of gun violence.
